/*
The "Binary" machine has a lower bound of 2**18 because of the byte lookup and
a block size of 4 rows.
That means that if the Main machine has degree D, the original Binary machine
can only be called D/4 times.
In the test below, the Main machine has degree 2**20 and the Binary machine is
called ~ 1/2 of the rows, so the original Binary machine runs out of rows.
Therefore witgen should fail.
